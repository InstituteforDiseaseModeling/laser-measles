# # Spatial Mixing Models Tutorial
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to choose and configure different spatial mixing models
# in the laser-measles framework and shows how they affect disease transmission patterns.
#
# ## What are Spatial Mixing Models?
#
# Spatial mixing models determine how infectious individuals in one location can infect
# susceptible individuals in other locations. They create a **mixing matrix** that quantifies
# the probability of contact between people from different patches (spatial locations).
#
# The tutorial covers:
# - Overview of available mixing models (gravity, radiation, competing destinations, stouffer)
# - Configuring models with different mixing patterns
# - Comparing spatial disease spread patterns
# - Understanding how mixing matrices affect transmission dynamics
#
# ## Available Mixing Models
#
# laser-measles provides four spatial mixing models:
#
# 1. **Gravity Model**: Based on gravitational attraction, depends on population sizes and distance
#    - Formula: $$M_{i,j} = k \cdot p_i^{a-1} \cdot p_j^b \cdot d_{i,j}^{-c}$$
#    - Good for modeling general mobility patterns
#
# 2. **Radiation Model**: Based on radiation theory of human mobility
#    - Less dependent on specific parameter tuning
#    - Often performs well for real-world mobility data
#
# 3. **Competing Destinations**: Extension of gravity model with destination competition and synergistic attraction
#    - Formula: $$M_{i,j} = k \frac{p_i^{a-1} p_j^b}{d_{i,j}^c} \left(\sum_{k \ne i,j} \frac{p_k^b}{d_{ik}^c}\right)^\delta$$
#    - Includes delta parameter for destination selection
#
# 4. **Stouffer Model**: Based on intervening opportunities theory
#    - Considers intermediate locations between origin and destination

# ## Setting up the scenario
#
# We'll create a scenario with multiple spatial nodes to demonstrate the effects
# of different mixing models on disease transmission patterns.

# ## How Mixing Matrices Work in Disease Transmission
#
# Before we compare models, let's understand how the mixing matrix is used in the infection process.
# In the compartmental model's infection component (`process_infection.py:114`), the force of infection
# is calculated as:
#
# ```python
# lambda_i = (beta * seasonal_factor * prevalence) @ mixer.mixing_matrix
# ```
#
# This matrix multiplication means:
# - `prevalence` is a vector of infectious individuals per patch
# - `mixing_matrix[i,j]` is the probability that someone from patch i mixes with patch j
# - The result `lambda_i[i]` is the total infectious pressure on patch i from all patches
#
# Key insight: **The mixing matrix determines which patches can "seed" infections in other patches**

# %% [markdown]
# ## Model 1: Gravity Mixing
#
# The gravity model assumes that mixing between patches follows a gravitational law:
# stronger attraction between larger populations, weaker with greater distance.

# ## Key Insights and Summary
#
# This tutorial demonstrated dramatic differences between gravity and radiation mixing models
# using a linear chain scenario and extreme parameter settings. Here are the key findings:
#
# ### Technical Configuration
#
# To create dramatic model differences in your analysis:
#
# ```python
# # Extreme gravity parameters for demonstration
# gravity_params = GravityParams(
#     a=1.0,  # Source population exponent
#     b=2.0,  # High target population attraction
#     c=1.0,  # Low distance decay for long-range connections
#     k=0.01  # Overall mixing scale
# )
#
# # Radiation parameters
# radiation_params = RadiationParams(
#     k=0.01,           # Same mixing scale for fair comparison
#     include_home=True # Include self-mixing
# )
#
# # Use linear or chain-like scenarios to highlight intervening opportunities
# ```
#
# ### Key Takeaway
# **The choice of spatial mixing model can dramatically affect both the spatial patterns
# and temporal dynamics of epidemic spread.** Always compare multiple models and use
# quantitative metrics (mixing distances, spatial coupling, epidemic velocity) to
# understand how your choice affects results.
#
# Different mixing models represent different theories of human mobility and contact patterns.
# The "best" model depends on your research question, available data, and the geographic
# context of your study.
