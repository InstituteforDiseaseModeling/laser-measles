"""
This module defines the Births component, which is responsible for simulating births in a population model.

Classes:

    Births:

        Manages the birth process within a population model, including initializing births, updating population data, and plotting birth statistics.

Usage:

    The Births component requires a model with a `population` attribute that has a `dob` attribute.
    It calculates the number of births based on the model's parameters and updates the population
    accordingly. It also provides methods to plot birth statistics.

Example:

    model = YourModelClass()
    births = Births(model)
    births(model, tick)
    births.plot()

Attributes:

    model (object): The population model.
    _initializers (list): List of initializers to be called on birth.
    _metrics (list): List to store timing metrics for initializers.
