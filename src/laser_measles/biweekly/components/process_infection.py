class InfectionProcess(BaseComponent):
    """
    Component for simulating the spread of infection in the model.

    This class implements a stochastic infection process that models disease transmission
    between different population groups. It uses a seasonally-adjusted transmission rate
    and accounts for mixing between different population groups.

    The infection process follows these steps:
    1. Calculates expected new infections based on:
       - Base transmission rate (beta)
       - Seasonal variation
       - Population mixing matrix
       - Current number of infected individuals
    2. Converts expected infections to probabilities
    3. Samples actual new infections from a binomial distribution
    4. Updates population states:
       - Moves current infected to recovered (configurable recovery period)
       - Adds new infections to infected population
       - Removes new infections from susceptible population

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : object
        The simulation model containing population states and parameters
    verbose : bool, default=False
        Whether to print detailed information during execution
    params : InfectionParams | None, default=None
        Component-specific parameters. If None, will use default parameters

    Notes
    -----
    The infection process uses a configurable recovery period and seasonal
    transmission rate that varies sinusoidally over time.
